<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Yes, I have written a dictionary. Worcester and Webster are all right in
their way, and Stormuth will do very well for Englishmen&mdash;but they’re
not up to date. Mrs. Century’s book is a bit better and even old Dr.
Standard’s Compendium of Useful Information includes my own words,
“bromide” and “sulphite.” It’s good enough for last year, but “Burgess
Unabridged” will give the diction of the year 1915.</p>

<p>For, the fact is, English is a growing language, and we have to let out
the tucks so often, that no last season’s model will ever fit it.
English isn’t like French, which is corseted and gloved and clad and
shod and hatted strictly according to the rules of the Immortals. We
have no Academy, thank Heaven, to tell what is real English and what
isn’t. Our Grand Jury is that ubiquitous person, Usage, and we keep him
pretty busy at his job. He’s a Progressive and what he likes, he’ll
have, in spite of lexicographers, college professors and authors of “His
Complete Works.” That’s the reason why English has ousted Volapük and
Esperanto as a world language. It snuggles right down where you live and
makes itself at home.</p>

<p>How does English shape itself so comfortably to the body of our thought?
With a new wrinkle here and a little more breadth there, with fancy
trimmings, new styles, fresh materials and a genius for adapting itself
to all sorts of wear. Everybody is working at it, tailoring it, fitting
it, decorating it. There is no person so humble but that he can suggest
an improvement that may easily become the reigning mode.</p>

<p>Slang, I once defined as “The illegitimate sister of Poetry”&mdash;but slang
is sometimes better than that; it often succeeds in marrying the King’s
English, and at that ceremony there are dozens of guests. There’s the
poker player, who con<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_x" id="page_x">{x}</a></span>tributes for his wedding present, “The limit” and
“Make good” and “Four flush.” Politics hands over “Boodle,” “Mugwump”
and “Gerrymander.” The thief presents his “Jimmy,” “Doss,” “Kip,”
“Heeler,” “Split,” “Lag,” “Swag” and “Dope.” The horse race gives us
“Neck and neck”; baseball, “Putting one over.” Even the baby offers
“Goo-goo.” Illustrations, however, are boring.</p>

<p>But slang, strictly, consists in the adaptation of phrases; it does not
often&mdash;not often enough at any rate&mdash;coin new words. Thieves’ patter or
jargon or cant provides us almost with a language of itself, and words
from the Underworld are continually being added to the language. Like
the turkey trot, “We first endure, then pity, then embrace.” So from all
sources the language recruits new phrases, new expressions, even new
rules of grammar. Horrible as they are to the conservative, common usage
accepts them and they become classic. Professor Lounsbury of Yale is
kept busy justifying them. He, alone of all grammarians, sees that the
split infinitive must come, that verbs must be constructed of nouns. He
recognizes the new function of the potential mood, in “I should worry”
and “Wouldn’t that jar you?”</p>

<p>Yes, it’s easy enough to coin a phrase, to adapt an old word to a new
use, like “Chestnut” and “Lemon” and “Peach.” It’s easy to abbreviate
words, like “Gent” and “Pants” and “Exam” and “Phone” and “Stylo.” It’s
easier still to fill the new dictionary with new derivatives from Latin
or Greek or crowd in French. The scientific word requires a little
invention. “Radioactive” and “Aileron” and “Hypofenyl-tribrompropionic”
need only a scholastic delving in ancient tongues. But to invent a new
word right out of the air or the cigarette smoke is another thing. And
that’s what I determined to do.</p>

<p>Yes, I know it has been tried, but it’s never been seriously and
deliberately gone about. It has been haphazard work, the result of a
mere accident, or vaudeville high spirits. But the way such neologisms
have become quickly current shows that here’s a field for high endeavor,
and a little success with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xi" id="page_xi">{xi}</a></span> “Blurb” and “Goop” encourage me to proceed in
the good work. We need so many new words, and we need ’em quick. The
question is: How to get ’em?</p>

<p>Of course, we might ransack the back numbers of the language and dig up
archaic words. Many such have been dropped from the original
Anglo-Saxon. There is “Dindle,” to shake, and “Foin” to thrust, and
“Gree” and “Lusk” and “Sweven.” But the need for most of them has long
gone by. We do not “Feutre” our spears, because we have no spears to
feutre. We carry no “Glaive,” we wear no “Coif.”</p>

<p>So with the bright gems of Elizabethan diction. A “Bonnibel” is now a
nectarine. To “Brabble” is now to “Chew the rag.” What is a
“Scroyle”?&mdash;a “Cad,” a “Bad Actor”? A “Gargrism” has become “A Scream.”
So the old names become mere poetic decorations. Why, the word “Fro” we
dare use only in a single collocation! And as for “Welkin,” “Lush,” and
“Bosky”&mdash;who dares to lead their metric feet into the prim paths of
prose? Let bygones be bygones. Look elsewhere.</p>

<p>Samoa has an ideal language, and there it was I got my inspiration.
Can’t we make English as subtle as Samoan? I wondered. There they have a
single word, meaning,
“A-party-is-approaching-which-contains-neither-a-clever-man-nor-a-pretty-woman.”
Another beautiful word describes
“A-man-who-climbs-out-on-the-limbs-of-his-own-breadfruit-tree-to-steal-the-breadfruit-of-his-neighbor.”
“<i>Suiia</i>” means “Change-the-subject-you-are-on-dangerous-ground.”
Another happy word expresses a familiar
situation&mdash;“To-look-on-owl-eyed-while-others-are-getting-gifts.” Have we
anything in English as charmingly tactful as this? No, our tongue is
almost as crude as pidjin-English itself, where piano is
“Box-you-fight-him-cry.”</p>

<p>But the time has come for a more scientific attempt to enlarge the
language. The needs of the hour are multifarious and all unfilled. There
are a thousand sensations that we can describe only by laborious phrases
or metaphors, a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xii" id="page_xii">{xii}</a></span> characters and circumstances, familiar to all,
which shriek for description.</p>

<p>It has, of course, been tried before. Think what a success the scheme
was when it was so long ago attempted. The first Nonsense Book
containing really new words was published in 1846 by Edward Lear, but he
failed to appreciate his opportunity. Of all his names, the “Jumblies”
alone survive. Lewis Carroll later went about it more deliberately. His
immortal poem, “Jabberwocky,” has become a classic; but even in that
masterpiece, how many words are adapted to modern use? “Slithy” perhaps
and “Chortle”&mdash;though no one has ever been able to pronounce it properly
to this day. Oh yes, “Galumph,” I forgot that. Not even “The Hunting of
the Snark” has made the title rôle popular amongst bromides. Why? His
fatal rule was, “Take care of the sounds and the sense will take care of
itself.”</p>

<p>A dozen years ago a little girl tried it with fair success. In her
“Animal Land, where there are no People,” however, I can find no word I
have ever heard used outside its covers, no word like “Hoodlum,” or
“Flunk” or “Primp,” “Quiz,” “Cabal” or “Fad” or “Fake.”</p>

<p>The thing must be done, and so I did it. Slang is sporadic; its
invention is crude and loose. It is a hit-or-miss method, without
direction or philosophy. Our task is serious; we must make one word
blossom where a dozen grew before. A myriad necessities urge us. I found
myself often confronted with an idea which baffled me and forced me to
talk gibberish. How, for instance, can one describe the appearance of an
elderly female in plush dancing a too conscientious tango? How do <i>you</i>,
gentle reader, portray your emotion when, on a stormy night, as you
stand on the corner the trolley-car whizzes by and fails to stop for
you? Where is the word that paints the mild, faint enjoyment of a family
dinner with your wife’s relations?</p>

<p>You see how inarticulate you are, now, don’t you, when a social
emergency arises?&mdash;when you want to give swift tongue to your emotions?
What can you say when you’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiii" id="page_xiii">{xiii}</a></span> jilted?&mdash;how mention the feeling of a
broken finger-nail on satin&mdash;your esthetic delight in
green-trading-stamp furniture? How do you feel with a person whose name
you cannot quite remember? Why, we need at least a gross of assorted
nouns this very day! What is the name of a business enterprise that was
born dead? What do you call the woman who telephones to you during
business hours? What is a woman who wears dirty white gloves? What is a
man who gives you advice “for your own good”? Well, behold a guide to
help you;&mdash;read “Burgess Unabridged.” It is the dictionary of the
Futurist language!</p>

<p>Yes, my modest “Unabridged” will “fill a long felt want.” It will
solidify the chinks of conversation, express the inexpressible, make our
English language ornamental, elegant, distinguished, accurate. Other
dictionaries have recorded the words of yesterday, my lexicon will give
the words of to-morrow. What matter if none of them is “derived from two
Greek words”? My words will be imaginotions, penandinkumpoops,
whimpusles, mere boojums rather than classic snarks, for I shall not
construct “Portmanteau” words, like Lewis Carroll. I shall create them
from instinctive, inarticulate emotions, hot from the depths of
necessity. No “Onomatopœia,” either, for I do not hold with those who
say that the origin of language is in the mere mimicry of natural
sounds. No, like the intense poetic pre-Raphaelite female, who says and
feels that her soul is violet, when I see a hand-embroidered necktie, I
dive deep in my inner consciousness and bring up, writhing in my hand,
the glad word, “Gorgule,” or “Golobrifaction” or “Diabob.”</p>

<p>For, as my friend, the Reverend Edward P. Foster, A.M., of Marietta,
Ohio, has pointed out, in his great work on Ro, the <i>a priori</i> method is
the only rational principle upon which to coin new words. Volapük,
Esperanto, Idiom Neutral, Interlingua and Ido all have fallen by the
wayside of this “philosophical” route. It is as futile to try to make
the sound suggest the sense. For, investigation will show that so many
senses are suggested that the word lacks definition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiv" id="page_xiv">{xiv}</a></span> Not only does
“stave” seem to imply a barrel, but music. And, if you take the sound
alone, we have such different meanings as wright, right, write and rite,
not to speak of exactly opposite interpretations in such word as
“cleave.”</p>

<p>What Ro, therefore, attempts so ambitiously, I do in a more humble
spirit, contenting myself with the manufacture of words to explain some
of the more subtle relationships and exigencies of civilized life. I
confess the work is, to a great extent, subjective and personal. I have
but ministered to my own direst needs.</p>

<p>So contriving, choosing my words from some vague sense of color, mood,
an instinctive feeling of appropriateness, I trust that I have not made
my method monotonous. I must confess, however, that in my
experimentation, certain sounds appealed more strongly than others to my
comic spirit. The frequent use of the “oo” will perhaps require an
apology, and the almost equally merry “aw.” The other “long” vowels,
such as “ee” and “ay” and “o” seemed inadequate to my use. Of
consonants, my “G” is, no doubt, most frequent. “G” supplies spuzz to a
word that can hardly be obtained elsewhere in the alphabet. “K” also has
a bite, but it is frequently too suggestive for our delicate
susceptibilities. “L”&mdash;what could one do in such a work, without the
gentle liquid that euphonizes the most savage of consonants! Also I
confess having fallen in love with the anapest.</p>

<p>And yet, many of these words will not, at first sound, seem appropriate.
Let me remind you of Mr. Oliver Herford’s not too original discovery
(most children make it earlier), than any word, when often repeated,
becomes strange and barbaric, even as his favorite “looking-glass” after
being pronounced several times, grows marvellously beautiful and
romantic.</p>

<p>So, as a corollary to this principle, you will, I hope, find that even
my fierce and uncouth syllables may, when iterated, grow less unusual,
strangely familiar, even; and, little by little, as their sharp corners
and edges are worn smooth by<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xv" id="page_xv">{xv}</a></span> use, they will fit into your conversation
and nestle into place, making your talk firmer, more expressive and
wonderfully adequate to your daily needs.</p>

<b>Ag´o-wilt</b>, <i>n.</i> 1. Sickening terror, sudden, unnecessary fear. 2.

<p>“What’s that smell? Is it smoke?&mdash;Is it?” You throw open the door and
have an agowilt; the staircase is in flames. But this is the fierce and
wild variety. Agowilts tamed for domestic use, are far more common. The
minute after you throw the burnt match into the waste-paper basket, the
agowilt comes.</p>

<p>It may be but a single extra step which isn’t there and the agowilt
playfully paralyzes your heart. So a sudden jerk of the elevator, the
startling stopping of the train, the automobile skidding, the
roller-coaster looping the loop&mdash;bring agowilts.</p>

<p>Vicariously you suffer as well, when the trapeze performers swing in
dizzying circles or do the “death dive.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens! I left my bag in the train!”&mdash;an agowilt quite as
painful. (See <i>Nulkin</i>.)</p>

<p>Why does your friend, reckless Robert, pause on the edge of the cliff?
Merely to delight you with an agowilt.</p>

<p>When I taught Fanny, the flirt, to swim, and she found herself in water
over her head, why did she scream and throw her arms about my neck? Was
it truly an agowilt? (See <i>Varm</i>.)</p>

<p>A circus poster is an alibosh; so is a seed catalogue, a woman’s age and
an actress’s salary. (See <i>Blurb</i>.)</p>

<p>There are verbal aliboshes too numerous to mention: “I have had such a
charming time!” and “No, I don’t think you’re a bit too fat, you are
just nice and plump.” (See <i>Gubble and Wumgush</i>.)</p>

<p>The saleswoman makes her living on the alibosh: “Yes, I think that hat
is very becoming.” She doesn’t believe it, you don’t believe it&mdash;it’s
only a part of the game&mdash;like the lies of horse-trading, the inspired
notices of theatrical failures or a prospectus of a gold mine.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Ezra P. McCormick stood in the middle of Myrtle Avenue at the
corner of Grandview Street the trolley car came hurtling past, ten
minutes behind time. Wildly she waved her parasol, but the car would
not, did not stop! Mrs. McCormick got bimped. Her bimp was the more
horrible, because the conductor turned and grinned at her, and three men
on the rear platform laughed, for Mrs. McCormick was very fat. (See
<i>Jurp</i>.)</p>

<p>Did you get that raise in your salary on New Year’s day, or did you get
bimped? Were you forgotten on Christmas? Did you draw to a flush and
fail to fill? You got bimped. Did you find you had no cash in your
pocket when it came time to pay the waiter? Did that firm cancel its
order? Bimps.</p>

<p>What did Mrs. Harris’s servant girl do on the very afternoon of the
dinner party? She bimped Mrs. Harris! She packed her imitation-leather
suitcase, grabbed her green umbrella and walked away.</p>

<p>The girl who stood “Waiting at the church” got the biggest bimp of all.

<p><b>Bleesh</b>, <i>a.</i> Revolting, disgusting, coarse.</p></div>

<p>Comic valentines are very bleesh; the newspaper “comic strip” with the
impossible adventure ending in catastrophic brutality; stars,
exclamation points and “Wows!” Especially a bull-dog, biting the seat of
a man’s trousers and revolving like a pinwheel&mdash;this is a bleesh. (See

<p>On the “jacket” of the “latest” fiction, we find the blurb; abounding in
agile adjectives and adverbs, attesting that this book is the “sensation
of the year;” the blurb tells of “thrills” and “heart-throbs,” of “vital
importance” and “soul satisfying revelation.” The blurb speaks of the
novel’s “grip” and “excitement.” (See <i>Alibosh</i>.)</p>

<p>The circus advertiser started the blurb, but the book publisher
discovered a more poignant charm than alliterative polysyllables. “It
holds you from the first page&mdash;”</p>

<p>Now, you take this “Burgess Unabridged”&mdash;it’s got a jump and a go to
it&mdash;it’s got a hang and a dash and a swing to it that pulls you right
out of the chair, dazzles your eyes, and sets your hair to curling. It’s
an epoch-making, heart-tickling, gorglorious tome of joy!</p>

<p>Who invented the diabob? The infamy is attributed to John Ruskin. At any

hectic tidies, splashes and drapes. Hand-painting was discovered.</p>

Now the jigsaw was master; now, the incandescent point that tortured
wood and leather into nightmare designs. Plaques began their vogue. (See

limned with Gibson heads. The decorative fan, genteel; the pampas grass,

<p><b>Dig´mix</b>, <i>v.</i> To engage in a necessary but painful task.</p></div>

<p>The type of the digmix is cleaning fish. At first it is disgusting,
untidy, uncomfortable. Then, you begin to enjoy it, rather; and finally,
as the clean, finished product of your skill appears, there is the
refreshing sense of duty well done. (See <i>Gloogo</i>.)</p>

<p>So with all household digmixes, stuffing feathers into pillows, peeling
onions, taking up carpets, putting up stove pipes, beating rugs,
attending to the furnace and washing dishes. You loathe the work, but,
when it is finished, you’re so glad you did it.</p>

<p>The mental digmix is less satisfactory, but just as necessary.
Discharging the cook is a digmix. Breaking the news of a death, refusing
a man who has proposed, explaining just why you came home at 2 <small>A.M.</small>,
accompanying a child to a dentist’s, getting a divorce, waiting on a
querulous invalid, having a lawsuit with a neighbor,&mdash;all are digmixes.

long, dull story. “Just a minute, now, I just want to tell you about&mdash;”

now,&mdash;doesn’t salad really bore you&mdash;unless it is served, as in
California, at the beginning of a meal, while you are still hungry?
Broiled live lobster! How succulent, yet how meagre its reward to the
appetite! Frogs’ legs are fidgelticks, and shad and grape fruit and
pistachios. Why can’t such tasteful delicacies be built with the
satisfactory architecture of the banana? The artichoke gives perhaps the
minimum of reward with the maximum of effect. (See <i>Voip</i>.)</p>

<p>And who does not flinch at a Bent’s water cracker?</p>

<p>To make cranberry sauce with the skins in, and cherry pie with the
stones, should be against the law.</p>

<p>So it is, to extract information from a railroad official after an
accident. Interviewing the master of a steamer is like getting the meat
out of a butternut, or the flesh out of a shrimp. Sooner or later, you
will give him up in discouragement. He’s a fidgeltick! (See <i>Jurp</i>.)</p>

<p>Politely you inquire of a ticket seller at the theatre; you might as
well talk with a foreigner, or a deaf man. All, all are fidgelticks!</p>

<p>Further back in the country a dog will make the best gollohix, baying at

<p>The gorm, when you offer him a cigar, puts it in his pocket and says he
“will smoke it after dinner.” When he loses his watch, he offers a
reward which shrinks amazingly when his property is returned and he is
sure of it back. (See <i>Igmoil</i>.)</p>

<p>The gorm never pays for his round of drinks. He manages so that the
other fellow shall settle for the taxi and the tickets. He will never
move up in the trolley-car or take his bundle from the seat. On the
railway, he manages successfully to occupy four places at once.</p>

<p>The gorm is the woman who tries to get in ahead of the line which forms
at the ticket office. She monopolizes the most attractive man in the
room to the exclusion of her sisters. At the bargain counter the gorm
holds three waists while she examines a fourth.</p>

<p>Children gorm candy and ice-cream; men gorm free lunches, and women in
Pullman cars gorm the ladies’ room for hours and hours, behind locked

is long before you can turn yourself about and make the world seem
normal.</p>

<p>The husband who has just shaved off his beard is a gowyop to his wife.
And his wife is a gowyop, after she has tinted her hair bright red. (See

<p>The gowyop is like that room you see in the mirror,&mdash;so like, and yet so
different. Your house, the day after the funeral, is a
gowyop&mdash;everything seems so strange.</p>

<p>A pretty child, with his two front teeth out; a person you haven’t seen
for many years and you now behold grown up; a son or a daughter who has
just been married, are gowyops. So is the dignified old gentleman in the
bathing suit. Or, that aristocratic dowager, who, when the house is on
fire, appears in her night-gown; and your cook, when she is “dressed
up.”</p>

gowns, she was in a cab, going to or from the process. (See <i>Mooble</i>.)</p>

<p>Later, on the train, I met Mr. Jirriwig, on the way to Venice. The train
flew by the bounteous beauties of Lombardy, historic and picturesque.
Did Mr. Jirriwig look out of the window? No, he was too busy reading his
Baedeker, learning about Venice. In Venice, he spent his time in
gondolas, reading up Florence. In Florence he sat at little café tables,
turning the pages of his red-covered book and getting acquainted with
Rome. So he saw Europe,&mdash;in type.</p>

years, and all the French they know is “<i>Combien?</i>” They are in a state

<b>Jul´lix</b>, <i>n.</i> 1. A mental affinity, with a similar taste and

<p>“He speaks my own language!” Smile if you will, and call it
sentimentality, but some there are, your jullixes, who laugh at the same
jokes as you and weep at the same sights. Out of the ruck of social
five-o’clocks you pick them, like single pearls out of dead oysters, and
they shine in your memory forever. Three words spoken, and you know them
as you know yourself; and you have floated lightly from ports of
conventionality, never to return. (See <i>Frime</i>.)</p>

<p>Such is your jullix. It is not only that he loves your authors and your
songs; not that he has been to the same queer foreign little towns that
you have “discovered”&mdash;or even that she has had the same operation. Of
your jullix you know far more than that&mdash;you know his soul.</p>

<p>When you are rich, sedate and prominent, comes one with whiskers and
calls you, “Bill!” He knew you when you wore short trousers; and he,
too, knows your language&mdash;that all but forgotten speech of your youth.
(See <i>Thusk</i>.)</p>

<p>Is she a jullix who was once engaged to the man whom you have married? A
jullix? Yes, but alas, she knows too much for friendship!</p>

<b>Kid´loid</b>, <i>n.</i> 1. A precocious or self-assertive infant; an <i>enfant

too ubiquitous.</p>

<p><b>Kid´loid</b>, <i>a.</i> Impertinent or offensive, in a childish way.</p></div>

<p>In the hotel the kidloid is manufactured and developed from shy and
timid modesty to the final perfect stages of conspicuous vulgarity. He
is like an improbable old man, or a cynical hag but without the charm of
age.</p>

<p>The kidloid, in comic papers, hides under the couch when his sister’s
beau is calling, and is subsequently bribed to silence. In actual life,
however, he is much more offensive when you know he’s about. (See
<i>Vorge</i>.)</p>

<p>The kidloid is called upon to recite “pieces” before company, and
invariably makes a fool of his parents.</p>

<p>The kidloid makes conversation an agony, and has the apparent power of a
multiple personality. He seems like at least a dozen persons when he is
in the room.</p>

<p>Kidloids are created by fond and idolatrous parents by the simple
process of giving them their own way.</p>

<p>The stage kidloid is a cross between an intelligent ape and a mummy. The
hotel kidloid is an anthropoid dynamo. (See <i>Gollohix</i>.)</p>

<p><b>Kipe</b>, <i>n.</i> A woman’s glance at another woman.</p></div>

<p>Up and down, from hat to heel, women kipe each other insolently as they
pass. In subway or in street-car, every woman who enters is kiped by her
shrewd-eyed sisters. In that keen first glance, every article of the new
comer’s raiment is appraised. (See <i>Flooijab</i>.)</p>

<p>So, at the employment agency, the housewife kipes the cook, and cook
kipes housewife, each turning away with the thought, “She won’t do for
me.” (See <i>Snosh</i>.)</p>

<p>Employer kipes the applicant for position, accepts or rejects. The
poker-player, with his last blue chip in the pot, kipes his four-card
draw. The fastidious smoker kipes the gift cigar. The golfer kipes his
“lie.”</p>

<p>Says Aunt Samanthy Hanks to Mary Jane at the county fair, as she kipes
the patchwork bedquilts in the gallery, “Mine’s better’n her’n.” Says
the mother of the bride, as she kipes the wedding presents spread out on
the table, “H’m! his folks must be close-fisted.” (See <i>Gefoojet</i>.)</p>

<p>As you whiz, motoring through the park, a car flashes by&mdash;but not too
fast for your automobile host to kipe it: “1913 36-6 ‘Strangler’&mdash; No

<p>The philosopher may be calm, even while his foot is awakening from a

<p>Did you ever hear an Englishman lallify his conversation with, “What I
mean to say is this,” and “if you know what I mean” and “do you see”? So
the shop girl lallifies her talk with “Listen here!” or “Say, listen!”
while she gropes for an idea. The preacher, barren of fresh thoughts,
lallifies his meager sermon. “Fourthly, beloved brethren&mdash;” (See
<i>Drillig</i>.)</p>

<p>A “talky” play is lallified till the house walks out. Like a song sung
too slowly, so is the lallified talk of the young man who doesn’t want
to escort that particular girl home. (See <i>Vorge</i> and <i>Xenogore</i>.)</p>

<p>The lallified book: Wide, wide margins and thick, thick paper&mdash;or, maybe
it is lallified only with adjectives or adverbs.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard that man Gerrish tell his favorite story, lallifying
it with dialect-dialogue till you yawned? Then, after you have forced a

<p>“When I was in Italy,” I began, carelessly&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, I’ve never been out of New York!” she whined. “I do wish I

<p>She was a leolump. I could not mention anything without her applying it
to herself. The word “objective” was not in her dictionary.</p>

<p>The leolump always caps your story with one stranger and bigger than
yours. He has acquired the art of the superlative. (See <i>Persotude</i>.)</p>

<p>Talk to a leolump actor of logarithms, and in an instant he will prove

carbo-hydrates in a congress of foreign chemists.</p>

<p>Conversation? Impossible when a leolump is present. Even if he has the
civility not to interrupt, which he hasn’t, the minute you stop speaking
he is astride his hobby and riding himself to social suicide. (See

<p>He has a million subjects ready in the pigeon-hole marked “I.”</p>

<b>Moo´soo</b>, <i>a.</i> 1. Sulky, out of sorts, blue, taciturn, discontented.
2. Unsuccessful; getting out of order; going wrong, delayed.</p></div>

<p>Moosoo is a mild form of “the dumps.” You are moosoo while waiting for
someone who is late, especially late for dinner; when your dress doesn’t
quite fit, or isn’t quite becoming.</p>

<p>Moosoo is the secondary stage of getting over acute ill humor. It is the
mood of the wife in her second year of marriage.</p>

<p>Moosoo is the clerk who is discontented with his position. Moosoo is the
salesman, when you return goods or exchange them. (See <i>Jurp</i>.)</p>

<p>Moosoo is the brakeman, when the train is delayed.</p>

<p>The wall-flower at the dance is moosoo, though her smiles are pungent.</p>

<p>Moosoo is the maiden when the young man fails to propose, although she
shows it not.</p>

<p>Moosoo is the interested escort, when the restaurant music is too loud
at dinner. (See <i>Huzzlecoo</i>.)</p>

<p>Children are moosoo, when they can’t go to the circus; the traveling
salesman, when his cigar leaks; and even the polite husband, when the
burned chops are set before him.</p>

<p>The weather, itself, can be moosoo, with clouds and dullness for weeks
at a time.</p>

dusty and unused upon the wall; old tiles and brass knockers.</p>

<p>The old flax-wheel in the corner is a nink; the framed old sporting

Pompeian bronze tripods, never lighted, in hotel corridors. (See

<p>A beefsteak party is a nink, and May-day dances and pageants; anything
revived, revamped for modern use. Doors, covered with nails and
decorative hinges bolted on; things sewed with thongs; imitation
parchment scrolls. Whale-oil lamps, ships’ lanterns; almost any object
of leather, copper, or brass. (See <i>Gefoojet</i>.)</p>

<p>Architectural ninks are imitation beams in the ceiling; hollow columns;

<b>O-ro-bal´di-ty</b>, <i>n.</i> 1. Modern witchcraft; Orientalism adapted to
Occidental intellects; Emerson-and-milk. 2. An alleged process of
getting wise quickly; a short cut to success.</p></div>

<p>Orobaldity in its most acute form, <i>i. e.</i>, Vedantic philosophy with the
asceticism left out, is particularly affected by females who are not
willing to gain success or happiness through mere effort. It consists of
gambling with the intellect, in order to gain a dishonest percentage of
mental profit.</p>

<p>Orobaldity is, in the main, a modern magic supposed to be controlled by
cryptic phrases and abracadabra such as “into the silence” and “holding
the thought.” It is not necessary to know the esoteric meaning of such
charms, or to exert any actual energy in obtaining one’s desires. (See
<i>Gubble</i>.)</p>

<p>Orobaldity is a thing of “vibrations” and “thought currents” and is
founded mainly upon analogies with wireless telegraphy and other modern
scientific discoveries. It finds occult meanings in colors and numbers.</p>

<p>Orobaldity is medieval mysticism, mainly practised by women who have
nothing else to do. (See <i>Mooble</i>.)</p>

<p>Actresses out of work find in orobaldity a good substitute for trying to
get an engagement. Neurotic and erotic temperaments find it an admirable
stimulant to egoism.</p>

<p>Have you ever in the theatre sat in front of a gabby gent, who paloodles
his girl with the story of the play, announcing each entrance and exit?</p>

<p>The paloodle is ubiquitous; at the baseball game, he explains each play;
at the pool-table, he tells you what you ought to do, or should have
done. He is proficient in the knowledge of how to run other people’s
business. (See <i>Drillig</i>.)</p>

<p>Old maids paloodle you with advice on how to train your children, or how
to manage a husband. (See <i>Lallify</i>.)</p>

<p>A horse falls on the slippery pavement. Immediately it is surrounded
with paloodles, suggesting blankets, and straps and buckles, and “Sit on
its head.” It’s the paloodle’s head that should be sat upon.</p>

<p>The stage manager paloodles the actor: “You cross here,” he says; and,
“You want to cry all through that scene.” No wonder the dramatic critic
also paloodles the actor on the opening night. (See <i>Yowf</i> and

<p>A man charged to the highest voltage of persotude could borrow any

<p>A quink is the Welch rarebit face, the expression of one serving at

golf hazard.</p>

<p>Women are quinked when they open a telegram; a boy, as he lights a
fire-cracker. A girl, when in front of the glass, as she turns around to
see if her underskirt is hanging down behind. A man, when he reads the
ticker tape, during a panic, or is buttoning up the back of his wife’s
dress.</p>

<p>A waiter is quinked when his customer takes the change from the

<p>She was not beautiful, but she was business-like; she knew how to spell
“its” and “it’s” and “there” and “their” and “they’re.” Her employer did

<p>Your jimmy-pipe is quisty, and so is that old mangy dressing-gown and
that comfortable, worn pair of corsets, and those shabby shoes you hate

<p>Awful were the ugly apartments of the 80’s, but the rooms were large and
airy; no such quisty flats nowadays.</p>

<p>Do you use an old-fashioned barber-style razor? Why? Because it’s

a fountain, with a stiff, scratchy nib. (See <i>Wijjicle</i>.)</p>

<p><b>Quoob</b>, <i>v.</i> To act differently than the rest; to commit a solecism;
to be in the wrong place.</p></div>

<p>As you stand on the doorstep arrayed in your best, a sudden pang smites
you. The door is opened. There is a look of blank astonishment, as you
are ushered in. No hostess comes to greet you, no gay appareled guests
are there. You are a quoob. The dinner is <i>next</i> Thursday, not to-night.
(See <i>Zobzib</i>.)</p>

<p>Which is worse, to be the only one in evening dress, when all the rest
are modestly clad, or to be yourself in street-clothes, surrounded by
low-necks and jewelry? In either case, you are a quoob.</p>

<p>If you are a natural born quoob, you are the only one of all the
audience to applaud, or cheer. At that sudden lull in the conversation,
you are the one to speak aloud. “No, I must say, I prefer the
old-fashioned night-gowns.”</p>

<p>Sadly the quoob waits in the drug-store for the girl who never comes.
(See <i>Quink</i>.) He goes to a party thought to be smart, to find he is the
only one of importance.</p>

<p>A woman who is too tall is a quoob, or a man who is too short. So are

<b>Rowtch</b>, <i>n.</i> One who has elaborate gastronomic technique.</p>

<p><b>Rowtch</b>, <i>v.</i> 1. To accomplish strange maneuvers over food by means
of a knife and fork. 2. To eat audibly or with excessive unction.</p></div>

<p>For the “Kansas City” or “banjo grip,” the rowtch, taking the fork in
his left hand, places his thumb and little finger below, while the
first, second and third fingers, as if touching the strings, press down
upon the top of the instrument. (See <i>Wog</i>.)</p>

<p>The “Texan” grip is still more desperate; the fork is gripped as if
about to stab&mdash;indeed it does stab, too!</p>

<p>Rowtching, however, can be done with a knife, as in the well known
operation upon the tonsils, incidental to meals among our lower classes;
the knife may be used to rowtch peas, or as a tool in that form of
food-modeling which children affect.</p>

<p>More delicate and refined, more dainty and feminine is that form of
rowtching which consists in jabbing a piece of meat upon the fork and
adding dabs of potato, turnip and gravy until the utensil is heaped with
its heterogeneous burden. Mashing and smoothing down of potato and
smearing it with butter affords the rowtch opportunity for his plastic
skill, or you may swirl your soda water glass.</p>

<p>Vegecide, the cutting of cooked potatoes and garden truck with a knife,
is the only rowtch that obtains in high life.</p>

<p>A slub is a cold, a headache, a boil or any affection in the
disreputable underworld of disease. There’s nothing of the aristocracy
of pain in the slub. It is, so to speak, a mere working illness.</p>

<p>Men’s slubs, however, are more intense than women’s. A man when he has a
slub, says, “Oh pshaw! it’s nothing.” But he expects, all the same, to
be assiduously attended. Every woman in the household must minister to
his misery. (See <i>Varm</i>.)</p>

<p>Women have slubs innumerable, and for the most part say nothing about
them, unless they want an excuse for staying away from a party. When the
society woman has a slub, she sends for a good looking doctor. (See

<p>Wall Street is where the snosh abounds. Advertise, circularize, collect
and disappear&mdash;that’s how they work the gold-mine snosh. (See

<p>Queer, isn’t it&mdash;a man who’s always “full of schemes” is always a snosh,
while a crank with one idea may succeed. Why? A snosh is always
imitating something. He is the theatrical manager who follows up a
successful play with a third-rate duplicate.</p>

<p>But, talking about plays, did you ever talk to a society woman who was
writing one? It’s a snosh. In the first place, she won’t finish it until
the year 1977 and then it will take her a double-lifetime to find a big
enough fool to produce it. Broadway is lined with snoshes&mdash;but the word
isn’t necessarily theatrical. The smart restaurant that insists on
evening dress is a snosh&mdash;and so is an actress who says she loves you.</p>

<p>In Reno dwells the married snosh. Any wedding performed upon a bride and

<p>At pool, tennis or golf, the spillix aids the amateur with proverbial

happening to be right on the spot.</p>

<p>A bargain is a spillix; an exciting conversation overheard on the

<p>Thousands of people, intending to cross on the Titanic, took the next

<p>Have you acquired the art of tashivation? Can you read the newspaper

being a husband.</p>

<p>The actress has an ear trained to distinguish emotions, and a tongue
trained to answer them without the conscious use of her brain. A friend
tells her a long, dull story, and her mind wanders through the Elysian
Fields of her own experiences, unheeding. Suddenly the tale ends&mdash;“And
there she was, right in the room with him!” What was it all about? Never
mind, the answer is easy: “Well, <i>what</i> do you think of that?” (See

<p>Tashivation is answering without listening, as one speaks to a
beggar&mdash;as one talks at a crowded reception, as one answers the man who
asks for a loan.</p>

<p>When a man explains machinery to a woman, she tashivates, her mind on

being chased. 2. A woman who telephones to men, or invites herself

<p>To most men the voriander is anathema. He would prefer to ask the
dullest girl in the world to dinner than to entertain the prettiest, who
has invited herself.</p>

<p>Sly and patent are the tricks of the voriander. She may telephone you:
“Have you got your car out of storage yet?” Or she may say, point-blank:
“Say, isn’t there a dinner coming to me along about now?” (See <i>Eegot</i>.)</p>

<p>The voriander is sometimes pretty, but never attractive. Her attempts
are usually dodged, but she still persists. “Confound it, I just <i>will</i>
get that man!” she says, and proceeds to voriander.</p>

<p>Never introduce a friend to a voriander. There are other kinder ways of
getting rid of her. A cat can be kissed to death, or smothered in fresh
butter; not the voriander. You have simply to leave town.</p>

<p>The voriander is “crazy” over you, and your purse. She writes you
perfumed notes, she telephones you during business hours. (See

<b>Yowf</b>, <i>n.</i> 1. One whose importance exceeds his merit. A rich, or
influential fool. 2. Stupidness, combined with authority.</p></div>

<p>You find the yowf sitting at the Captain’s table on shipboard; and at
the speakers’ dais at banquets. He is top-heavy with importance, and
soggy with self-esteem.</p>

<p>Among the yowfs present were: The Mayor of the Small Town; a state
senator; the Dock Commissioner; a bank president, two consuls, the
Commandant of the Navy Yard, a police judge, and the Treasurer of the
Wild Cat Club. (See <i>Edicle</i>.)</p>

<p>The yowf is long on dignity, and short on charm; but he has to be waited
on first. The female yowf has a 46 bust measure, and is important mainly
on account of her clothes.</p>

<p>It is always a yowf who gives the reception to visiting celebrities. He
travels all over the world, and somehow, is able to mingle constantly
with people with real brains. (See Machizzle.)</p>

personality dominates. 2. A monologuist or violent talker.</p>

<p><b>Zeech´ous</b>, <i>a.</i> Lively, but tiresome; exhaustingly original.</p></div>

<p>The zeech is usually a good talker and a bad conversationalist; he
colors the party, you have to take his tone. He may bring in the
sunshine but he destroys those subtler half-lights which give
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Curiously, the zeech is a great mixer and yet he will not mix; things
must go his way. He is dynamic but has nothing in reserve. (See
<i>Spuzz</i>.)</p>

<p>There are no surprises in the zeech&mdash;you know what he is going to do and
say. You will laugh, but in the end be bored. He makes the party “go,”
but prevents its being an occasion.</p>

<p>The zeech is conspicuous, brilliant&mdash;but exhausting.</p>

<p>You invite the zeech to dinner, and the first time you are enthusiastic
about him. By the third, however, your wife ventures to say, “Oh, let’s
not have him <i>this</i> time!” (See <i>Cowcat</i>.)</p>

<p>The zobzib “means well”&mdash;but deliver us from our friends! He comes too
early and he stays too late. He is always in the way. He calls just
before dinner, but he will not sit down and dine with you. He is always
“just going.” He is fond of picking out a tune on the piano with one
finger.</p>

<p>When a zobzib enters, you just know he is going to break or tip over
something, or spill claret on the table cloth. He will surely slip on
the rug. He is a bull in a china shop, he is as hilarious as a wet
Newfoundland dog. (See <i>Splooch</i>.)</p>

<p>The female zobzib gives you advice, “for your own good.” She asks you to
buy tickets for church fairs and charity concerts.</p>

<p>A zobzib cannot help missing the train, he cannot help forgetting the
theatre tickets. That’s why he’s a zobzib. (See <i>Rawp</i>.)</p>

<p>I’ve often thought I’d like to be a drunkard, so some nice, sweet zobzib
would marry me, to reform me.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
